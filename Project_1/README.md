## Python_Introduction_Project_1_Question_1
Write a program that collects 3 results of temperature measurement. The range of values for each measurement is [-10,40]
The program should print the average temperature for the above measurements. Exactly two digits should be printed
after the point
In addition, the rounded average value must be printed on a separate line (for example, for 6.23, print 24, and for 2.30
Print 30. For 5.x, print the closest even integer.

## Python_Introduction_Project_1_Question_2
Write a program that accepts three characters, and two integers; The first x and the second y.
A string consisting of three parts should be printed as follows:
First part - the first received character, concatenated to itself x times.
Second part - the third character you received is concatenated to itself x - y times (note what happens when 0 < x - y).
Third part - the second character and the third character are attached, and concatenated to themselves of part (integer(y/x))*2.
.integer part of(y/x) = 3 ,x = 3, y = 10 for, for example. twice
In addition, the length of the resulting final string should be printed on a separate line (note that x â€“ y
may be negative, and in practice it does not add to the length of the string. Again, use a logical expression (appears in exercise 3)
in order to calculate the length of the second part).
